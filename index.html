    <p>According to all known laws
        of aviation,
        
          
        there is no way a bee
        should be able to fly.
        
          
        Its wings are too small to get
        its fat little body off the ground.
        
          
        The bee, of course, flies anyway
        
          
        because bees don't care
        what humans think is impossible.
        
          
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
        
          
        Ooh, black and yellow!
        Let's shake it up a little.
        
          
        Barry! Breakfast is ready!
        
          
        Ooming!
        
          
        Hang on a second.
        
          
        Hello?
        
          
        - Barry?
        - Adam?
        
          
        - Oan you believe this is happening?
        - I can't. I'll pick you up.
        
          
        Looking sharp.
        
          
        Use the stairs. Your father
        paid good money for those.</p>
